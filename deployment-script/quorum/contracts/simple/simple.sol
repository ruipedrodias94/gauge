        Mappings is another way of declaring data
        We can think of an Mapping as a Key_Value store.
        So in this example:
            .key = string
            .value = bytes32
        So, we will store accounts in map. And we will lookup for accounts in map by the string.

    function open(string _key, bytes32 _value) {

    }

    // Return the values added previously 
    function query(string _key) constant returns(bytes32) {
        return map[_key];
